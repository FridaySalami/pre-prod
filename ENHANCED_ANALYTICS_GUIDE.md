# Enhanced Sales Analytics Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Your current sales analytics page shows only current month data without historical context. This guide will help you transform it into a powerful business intelligence tool with:

   ```

2. **Verify the migration:**
   ```sql
   SELECT reporting_month, COUNT(*) as products, SUM(units_ordered) as total_units 
   FROM historical_sales_data 
   GROUP BY reporting_month 
   ORDER BY reporting_month;
   ```

    title,
    units_ordered,

)
SELECT 
    '2024-08-01'::DATE as reporting_month,
    "SKU" as sku,
    "(Parent) ASIN" as parent_asin,
    "(Child) ASIN" as child_asin,
    "Title" as title,
    COALESCE("Units ordered", 0) as units_ordered,
    -- ... (data conversion logic)
FROM sales_august  -- Your new monthly table
ON CONFLICT (reporting_month, sku) DO UPDATE SET
    units_ordered = EXCLUDED.units_ordered,
    ordered_product_sales = EXCLUDED.ordered_product_sales,
