## 🔧 How It Works (Technical)

### 1. **API Request** (Server-Side)
```typescript
// In: +page.server.ts
const catalogService = new CatalogService(spApiClient);
const catalogData = await catalogService.getProduct(asin);
```

### 2. **API Response** (From Amazon)
```json
{
  "images": [{
    "images": [
      { "variant": "MAIN", "link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/...", "width": 1500, "height": 1500 },
      { "variant": "PT01", "link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/...", "width": 1500, "height": 1500 },
      { "variant": "PT02", "link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/...", "width": 1500, "height": 1500 }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### 3. **Data Processing** (catalog-service.ts)
```typescript
const productImages: CatalogImage[] = images.map((img: any) => ({
  variant: img.variant,  // MAIN, PT01, PT02, etc.
  link: img.link,        // Direct Amazon CDN URL
  height: img.height,
  width: img.width
}));
```

### 4. **Display** (Svelte Component)
```svelte
{#each productImages.slice(0, 8) as image}
  <img src={image.link} alt="{productTitle} - {image.variant}" />
{/each}
```

## ❓ Why Some Images Missing?

### A+ Content / Enhanced Brand Content
**What it is:** Marketing images created by brand owners (Callebaut)  
**Where it shows:** Below product carousel on Amazon  
**Why you don't have it:** Not available via Catalog Items API v2022-04-01  
**Examples:**
- Recipe ideas with the product
- Brand story/heritage images
- Product comparison charts
- Lifestyle photography (chef using product)

### Customer Photos
**What it is:** Images uploaded by customers in reviews  
**Where it shows:** Review section on Amazon  
**Why you don't have it:** Requires separate Reviews API access  
**Examples:**
- User photos of melted chocolate
- Photos of finished recipes
- Packaging condition photos

### Videos
**What it is:** Product demo videos, 360° spins  
**Where it shows:** Product image carousel on Amazon  
**Why you don't have it:** Not included in Catalog API response  
**Examples:**
- How to melt/temper chocolate
- 360° package view
- Recipe demonstration

## ✅ Is This Normal?

**YES!** Your implementation is correct and complete.

### What Amazon Catalog API Provides:
- ✅ Official product photography (MAIN + PT variants)
- ✅ Package shots (front, back, nutritional)
- ✅ Detail shots (close-ups, in-use)
- ✅ Technical images (labels, certifications)

### What Amazon Catalog API Does NOT Provide:
- ❌ A+ Content images (brand marketing)
- ❌ Customer review photos
- ❌ Product videos
- ❌ Promotional/seasonal banners
- ❌ Seller-specific marketing images

**The official product images you're showing are identical to what Amazon uses in their main product carousel.** 🎯

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **You have all official product images** ✅  
   → Same images Amazon shows in product carousel

2. **Missing A+ Content is expected** ⚠️  
   → Not available via Catalog Items API

3. **Your implementation is correct** ✅  
   → Getting maximum data available from API

4. **Image quality is identical** ✅  
   → Direct links to Amazon's CDN (1500x1500px typically)

5. **The difference is marketing content** 📊  
   → A+ Content, customer photos, videos are separate systems

## 🚀 If You Want More Images...

### Option 1: Accept Current Implementation ✅
**Best Option:** What you have is industry-standard for seller tools.  
All Amazon seller tools (Jungle Scout, Helium 10, etc.) show the same images you're showing.

### Option 2: Manual Enhancement 🔧
**Upload your own:** Add marketing images to your own database  
**Pros:** Full control, branded content  
**Cons:** Manual work, not automated

### Option 3: Web Scraping ⚠️
**Scrape Amazon pages:** Extract A+ Content images  
**Pros:** Automated, gets everything  
**Cons:** Against Amazon TOS, fragile, can break

### Recommendation:
**Stick with current implementation.** You're getting all the product photography that matters for competitive analysis and pricing decisions. A+ Content is marketing fluff that doesn't affect your business decisions.
