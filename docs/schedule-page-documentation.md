# Schedule Page Documentation

## Overview

The Schedule Page is a comprehensive workforce management system built with SvelteKit. It provides calendar-based scheduling, employee management, leave tracking, and performance monitoring capabilities.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Calendar Views**: Month, week, and day views for schedule visualization
- **Employee Management**: Add, view, and manage employees with role-based organization
- **Schedule Management**: Create and manage work schedules with shift assignments
- **Leave Management**: Handle employee leave requests with different types and status tracking
- **Weekly Patterns**: Set recurring weekly schedules for employees
- **Hour Tracking**: Automatic calculation and tracking of scheduled work hours

### Performance Features
- **Optimized Data Fetching**: Cached API calls with request deduplication
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking and memory usage monitoring
- **Preloading**: Adjacent month data preloading for improved UX
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient rendering for large datasets

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and descriptions for assistive technology
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **High Contrast Support**: Adapts to user's contrast preferences
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences

## Architecture

### Components
- `+page.svelte`: Main schedule page component
- `ScheduleManager.svelte`: Weekly pattern management
- `EmployeeLeaveModal.svelte`: Individual leave management
- `BulkLeaveModal.svelte`: Bulk leave operations
- `ErrorBoundary.svelte`: Error handling and recovery

### Services
- `optimizedFetcher.ts`: Cached data fetching with deduplication
- `performanceMonitor.ts`: Performance tracking utilities
- `validators.ts`: Input validation and sanitization
- `hours-service.ts`: Working hours calculation
- `batchUpdateService.ts`: Bulk data operations

## Data Models

### Employee
```typescript
interface Employee {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'Manager' | 'Supervisor' | 'Team Lead' | 'Associate' | 'Trainee';
}
```

### Schedule Item
```typescript
interface ScheduleItem {
  id: string;
  employeeId: string;
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD format
  shift: 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'night';
}
```

### Leave Request
```typescript
interface LeaveRequest {
  id: string;
  employee_id: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
  leave_type_id: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  notes?: string;
}
```

## Usage

### Adding Employees
1. Click "Add Employee" button
2. Fill in name and select role
3. Submit form - data is validated before submission

### Creating Schedules
1. Click on a calendar date or use "Add Schedule" button
2. Select employee, date, and shift
3. Submit - hours are automatically calculated

### Managing Leave
1. Click on an employee in the calendar
2. Select leave type and date range
3. Submit - conflicts with existing schedules are handled

### Navigation
- Use month navigation arrows to change months
- Toggle between calendar and pattern management views
- Switch between month/week/day views as needed

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Employee data: 5 minutes cache
- Schedule data: 2 minutes cache (more dynamic)
- Leave data: 2 minutes cache
- Weekly patterns: 15 minutes cache (less frequent changes)

### Optimization Features
- Request deduplication prevents duplicate API calls
- Preloading of adjacent months for smooth navigation
- Intersection Observer for efficient rendering
- Performance monitoring tracks slow operations

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and observers
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Performance monitoring with memory usage tracking

## Error Handling

### Error Boundary
- Catches and handles application errors gracefully
- Provides retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Offers error reporting functionality

### Validation
- Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- Data validation ensures data integrity
- Type checking with TypeScript

### Retry Logic
- Automatic retry for failed operations (max 3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff for network issues
- User feedback through toast notifications

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Support
- Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Enter/Space activation for buttons and calendar dates
- Arrow key navigation for calendar (planned enhancement)

### Screen Reader Support
- Descriptive ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Live regions for dynamic content updates
- Structured heading hierarchy

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast mode support
- Clear focus indicators
- Reduced motion support
- Color-blind friendly design

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- `employees`: Employee master data
- `schedules`: Individual schedule assignments
- `employee_schedules`: Weekly pattern definitions
- `leave_requests`: Leave request data
- `leave_types`: Leave type definitions
- `scheduled_hours`: Daily hour totals
- `daily_metrics`: Legacy hour tracking (for compatibility)

### Data Flow
1. Fetch data using optimized fetcher
2. Validate all incoming data
3. Transform for UI consumption
4. Cache for performance
5. Update UI with reactive stores

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Create proper TypeScript interfaces
2. Add validation logic
3. Implement error handling
4. Add performance monitoring
5. Ensure accessibility compliance
6. Write tests

### Code Organization
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use services for business logic
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Monitor performance impact

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for validators and utilities
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for optimization verification
- Accessibility tests with axe-core

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time collaboration with WebSockets
- Advanced filtering and search
- Mobile app with offline support
- Integration with external calendar systems
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Multi-tenant support

### Performance Improvements
- Service worker for offline functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Slow Loading**: Check network tab for slow API calls, verify caching is working
2. **Memory Leaks**: Monitor memory usage, ensure proper cleanup in components
3. **Calendar Not Updating**: Verify data fetching, check for validation errors
4. **Accessibility Issues**: Test with screen reader, verify ARIA labels
