# Process Map Documentation

## 1. Overview

The Process Map page provides a high-level visual representation of the key business workflows at Parker's Foodservice. It is designed to offer a clear and intuitive understanding of how different operational areas connect, from order processing to dispatch. This tool is essential for training, process analysis, and identifying opportunities for improvement.

The map is interactive, allowing users to click on different stages of the process to get more detailed information.

## 2. Key Components

The process map is divided into several key stages, each representing a critical part of the business workflow:

-   **Order Reception**: How orders are received from different channels (Amazon, eBay, Shopify, etc.).
-   **Order Processing**: The steps taken to process orders in Linnworks, including stock allocation and payment verification.
-   **Picking & Packing**: The warehouse process for gathering items and preparing them for shipment.
-   **Dispatch**: The final stage where packages are handed over to carriers for delivery.
-   **Customer Service**: How customer queries and issues are handled post-dispatch.
-   **Inventory Management**: How stock levels are managed and replenished.

## 3. How to Use the Process Map

The Process Map is designed to be an interactive and educational tool.

### Navigating the Map

-   **View the Flow**: Follow the arrows to understand the standard sequence of operations.
-   **Click for Details**: Click on any process block (e.g., "Picking & Packing") to view a popup with more detailed information, including:
    -   Key personnel involved.
    -   Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
    -   Connected systems or documents.

### Using the Map for Analysis

-   **Identify Bottlenecks**: By visualizing the workflow, you can more easily spot potential bottlenecks where processes may be slowing down.
-   **Training New Staff**: The map is an excellent resource for new employees to quickly understand how the business operates.
-   **Process Improvement**: Use the map as a starting point for discussions about process improvements (Kaizen). By understanding the current state, you can better plan for the future state.

## 4. Data Source

The process map itself is a static visual asset, but the detailed information panels associated with each process block may pull data from other parts of the system, such as links to employee roles or SOP documents.

## 5. Maintenance

The process map should be reviewed and updated quarterly, or whenever a significant change is made to a business process. To request an update, please submit a Kaizen idea with the proposed changes.
