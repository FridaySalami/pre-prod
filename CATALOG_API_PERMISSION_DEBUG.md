# Catalog API 403 - Permission Troubleshooting

**Date**: 13 October 2025  
**Status**: New refresh token generated, still getting 403

---

## ‚úÖ What We've Verified

1. ‚úÖ **Endpoint is correct**: Using `sellingpartnerapi-eu.amazon.com` (Europe)
2. ‚úÖ **Region is correct**: `eu-west-1` matches UK marketplace
3. ‚úÖ **New refresh token works**: Can generate LWA access tokens
4. ‚úÖ **Authentication works**: Getting 403, not 401 (means we're authenticated)
5. ‚úÖ **Token is being used**: Confirmed via fresh token test

## ‚ùå What's Still Wrong

**Catalog API returns**: 403 "Access to requested resource is denied"

This means: **The refresh token doesn't have the required permission scope**

---

## üîç Critical Question

**When you generated the new refresh token, which Seller Central did you use?**

### Option A: sellercentral.amazon.co.uk ‚úÖ CORRECT
- This is the UK Seller Central
- Generates tokens for Europe region
- Should work with `sellingpartnerapi-eu.amazon.com`

### Option B: sellercentral.amazon.com ‚ùå WRONG
- This is the US Seller Central  
- Generates tokens for North America region
- Would only work with `sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com`

## üéØ Next Steps

### Step 1: Verify Authorization URL Used

**The correct authorization URL should be**:
```
https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/apps/authorize/consent?application_id=...
```

**NOT**:
```
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/apps/authorize/consent?application_id=...
```

### Step 2: Check Which Permissions Were Selected

When you clicked "Authorize", you should have seen checkboxes for:
- [ ] Product Listing ‚Üê **MUST BE CHECKED**
- [ ] Pricing
- [ ] Selling Partner Insights
- [ ] Inventory and Order Tracking
- [ ] Amazon Warehousing and Distribution
- [ ] Brand Analytics

**Question**: Was "Product Listing" checked when you authorized?

### Step 3: Verify the App Registration

Your app might be registered in the wrong Seller Central:

1. Go to **sellercentral.amazon.co.uk** (UK)
2. Navigate to: Apps & Services ‚Üí Develop Apps
3. Look for app with ID: `86a5e69c4a884eab8d37ff6f28fc6ff4`
4. Check if it exists

**If it doesn't exist in UK Seller Central**:
- Your app is registered in US Seller Central
- You need to register it in UK Seller Central
- Or use a different app that's registered in UK

## üîß Diagnostic Test

Run this to check if the token is for the wrong region:

```bash
# Test with EU endpoint (what we're using now)
curl -X GET "https://sellingpartnerapi-eu.amazon.com/catalog/2022-04-01/items/B08BPCC8WD?marketplaceIds=A1F83G8C2ARO7P" \
  -H "x-amz-access-token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "x-amz-date: 20251013T000000Z" \
  -H "Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 ..."

# vs

# Test with NA endpoint
curl -X GET "https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com/catalog/2022-04-01/items/B08BPCC8WD?marketplaceIds=ATVPDKIKX0DER" \
  -H "x-amz-access-token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "x-amz-date: 20251013T000000Z" \
  -H "Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 ..."
```

If NA endpoint works but EU doesn't ‚Üí **Token is registered for wrong region**

## üéØ Most Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Product Listing Role Not Selected During Authorization

**Symptom**: Everything else works, only Catalog API fails  
**Cause**: You authorized the app but didn't check "Product Listing"  
**Fix**: Re-authorize with "Product Listing" checked

**Steps**:
1. Go to sellercentral.amazon.co.uk
2. Apps & Services ‚Üí Develop Apps ‚Üí Your App
3. Click "Edit" or "View LWA Credentials"

6. Complete authorization

### Issue 2: App Registered in Wrong Seller Central

**Symptom**: 403 on ALL APIs, not just Catalog  
**Cause**: App is in sellercentral.com (US) but you're using sellercentral.co.uk (UK) marketplace  
**Fix**: Register app in UK Seller Central

**To check**:
1. Try logging into sellercentral.amazon.com (US)
2. Look for the same app ID
3. If found there ‚Üí that's the problem

**Solution**:
- Either: Use US marketplaces (A2EUQ1WTGCTBG2 instead of A1F83G8C2ARO7P)

### Issue 3: Catalog API Requires Additional Step

**Symptom**: Brand new app, never worked  
**Cause**: Some APIs require explicit enablement beyond role selection  
**Fix**: Contact Amazon Seller Support

**To verify**:
