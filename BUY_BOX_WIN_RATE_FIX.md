# Buy Box Win Rate Fix

## Issue
The listing health score was showing **0.0% Buy Box Win Rate** even when the actual data showed **100% win rate** (1 out of 1 appearance = 100%).

The recommendation displayed:
```
Improve Buy Box Win Rate
Currently at 0.0%. Focus on competitive pricing and maintaining consistent stock levels.
```

But the competitor activity table showed: **"BUY BOX WINS: 1 (100%)"**

## Root Cause
**Property name mismatch** between the analytics API response and the health score calculation.

### The Data Flow:

1. **API Endpoint** (`src/routes/api/buy-box-alerts/product/[asin]/+server.ts`):
   - Line 246: Returns analytics object with `buyBoxWinRate` (camelCase)
   ```typescript
   return {
     buyBoxWinRate: (buyBoxWins / history.length) * 100 || 0,
     // ... other fields
   };
   ```

2. **Page Server** (`src/routes/buy-box-alerts/product/[asin]/+page.server.ts`):
   - Line 119: Was looking for `buybox_win_rate` (snake_case) ❌
   ```typescript
   winRate: alertData.analytics?.buybox_win_rate || 0,  // WRONG!
   ```
   - Because the property didn't exist, it defaulted to `0`

3. **Health Score Calculator** (`src/lib/amazon/listing-health.ts`):
   - Received `winRate: 0` from the incorrect property lookup
   - Generated recommendation: "Currently at 0.0%"

## The Fix
Changed property name from snake_case to camelCase:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 119):
winRate: alertData.analytics?.buybox_win_rate || 0,

// AFTER:
winRate: alertData.analytics?.buyBoxWinRate || 0,
```

## Expected Result
- ✅ Health score will now correctly show **100% Buy Box Win Rate** 
- ✅ No recommendation to improve win rate (since it's already at 100%)
- ✅ Buy Box component score will be higher (was getting 0.2 points, should get 1.0 points)

## Testing
Refresh the product page for ASIN B00870SN0A and verify:
1. Buy Box win rate shows correctly in recommendations
2. If win rate is high (≥80%), no "Improve Buy Box Win Rate" recommendation appears
3. Buy Box component score increases to reflect actual performance
