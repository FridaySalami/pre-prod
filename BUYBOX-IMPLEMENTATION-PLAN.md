# üì¶ Buy Box Monitoring System - Implementation Plan

Based on the existing architecture and the desired functionality, here's our implementation plan:

## üìã Today's Focus

1. **Create Supabase Tables**
   - Set up `buybox_data` to store all scan results
   - Set up `buybox_jobs` to track job execution
   - Set up `buybox_failures` to log errors

2. **Build Full Scan Endpoint**
   - Create `/api/buybox/full-scan` endpoint
   - Implement SKU randomization
   - Add rate limiting with jitter
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Log results to Supabase

3. **Add Profitability Logic**
   - Add opportunity flag calculation
   - Integrate with SKU cost data
   - Calculate profit margins

4. **Build History Dashboard**
   - Create job history view
   - Show scan results over time
   - Add filtering by various criteria

## üèóÔ∏è Approach

### 1. Database Schema First
We'll start by creating the database tables needed to store scan results, job data, and error logs.

### 2. Backend API Implementation
Next, we'll build the full scan endpoint that will:
- Retrieve all SKUs that need to be monitored
- Randomize the order
- Process them with rate limiting
- Store results in the database

### 3. Frontend Integration
Finally, we'll integrate the frontend to display:
- Historical data
- Current Buy Box status
- Opportunity insights

## üß© Core Components to Create

1. **Full Scan API Handler**
   - Initiates the scan process
   - Manages rate limiting and retries
   - Updates job status

2. **Profitability Calculator**
   - Calculates if price adjustments would be profitable
   - Sets opportunity flags

3. **Job History Dashboard**
   - Displays past scan jobs
   - Shows success/failure statistics

4. **Results Explorer**
   - Views all scan results
   - Filters by various criteria (won/lost, opportunity, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Rate Limiting**: 1 request per second + jitter (0-400ms)
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 retries for 429/503/500 errors with exponential backoff
- **Make.com Integration**: Will trigger the scan endpoint on schedule
- **Data Efficiency**: We'll store scan results to minimize API calls to Amazon

Let's get started!
